    <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Elon Musk's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1971</strong> - Born in Pretoria, South Africa</li>
      <li>
        He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He
        landed in the U.S. as a transfer student to the University of
        Pennsylvania.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth,
        through electric car maker Tesla -- and in space, via rocket producer
        SpaceX.
      </li>
      <li>
        He owns 23% of Tesla but has pledged more than half his stake as
        collateral for loans; Forbes has discounted his stake to take the loans
        into account.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tesla CEO stepped down as chairman in 2018, after making alleged
        "false statements" about a plan to take Tesla private, triggering an SEC
        probe.
      </li>
      <li>
        SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is valued at $74 billion after its latest
        funding round in February 2021.
      </li>
    </ul>
